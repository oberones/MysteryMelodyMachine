# Fugue Mode Rest Support - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The fugue mode has been enhanced to include comprehensive support for rests in the original subject as well as all subsequent variations and contrapuntal elements. This enhancement makes the fugue generation more musically authentic and expressive.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Data Structure Updates

**File: `src/fugue.py`**

- **Note Type Definition**: Updated the `Note` TypedDict to support optional pitch values:
  ```python
  class Note(TypedDict):
      pitch: Optional[int]    # MIDI note number (None for rests)
      dur: float              # Duration in quarter notes
      vel: int                # Velocity (1-127, ignored for rests)
  ```

### 2. Subject Generation Enhancement

- **Strategic Rest Placement**: Added 30% probability of including rests in generated subjects
- **Rest Patterns**: Implemented various rest patterns including:
  - Anacrusis (upbeat start with rest)
  - Mid-phrase breathing spaces
  - End-phrase pauses
  - Syncopated patterns
- **Variety**: Different combinations of rhythmic and rest patterns for musical diversity

### 3. Transformation Methods Updated

All fugue transformation methods now properly handle rests:

- **`transpose()`**: Preserves rests unchanged while transposing notes
- **`invert()`**: Preserves rests unchanged while inverting pitches around axis
- **`retrograde()`**: Maintains rests in their new positions when reversing
- **`time_scale()`**: Scales rest durations proportionally with notes
- **`slice_by_time()`**: Correctly handles rests within time slices

### 4. Compositional Elements Enhanced

#### Episode Generation
- **Phrase Rests**: 25% chance of quarter-note rests between fragments for phrasing
- **Strategic Silences**: Rests placed at musically appropriate moments
- **Connecting Passages**: Improved logic to handle rests when creating connecting notes

#### Countersubject Generation
- **Complementary Rests**: 15% chance of additional rests beyond pattern-based ones
- **Rhythmic Contrast**: Rest placement creates complementary rhythm to subject
- **Voice Separation**: Strategic rests enhance clarity between voice parts

#### Complex Episodes
- **Staggered Entries**: Different voices start with rests of varying lengths
- **Textural Variety**: 20-30% chance of rests between fragments in different voices
- **Breathing Spaces**: Longer rests in augmented voice parts

#### Cadential Material
- **Dramatic Rests**: 20% chance of opening rest for dramatic effect
- **Breath Before Resolution**: 30% chance of brief rest before final tonic

### 5. Playback Integration

- **MIDI Handling**: Updated `get_next_step_note()` to return `None` for rests, ensuring proper silence
- **Logging**: Enhanced debug logging to track rest generation and placement
- **Timing**: Rest durations correctly calculated and scheduled

## Musical Benefits

### Authentic Bach-like Characteristics
- **Breathing Spaces**: Natural phrasing similar to instrumental and vocal music
- **Voice Independence**: Clearer separation between polyphonic voices
- **Rhythmic Sophistication**: More complex rhythmic patterns including syncopation

### Enhanced Expression
- **Dramatic Tension**: Strategic silences create musical tension and release
- **Articulation**: Clearer phrase boundaries and musical gestures
- **Texture Variation**: Dynamic changes in polyphonic density

### Technical Improvements
- **Voice Leading**: Rests provide space for smoother voice leading
- **Counterpoint**: Better adherence to classical contrapuntal principles
- **Musical Flow**: More natural phrasing and breathing patterns

## Implementation Statistics

Based on testing:
- **Subject Generation**: ~30% of subjects include rests (configurable)
- **Episode Generation**: ~25% chance of phrase rests between fragments
- **Countersubject**: ~15% additional rest probability beyond pattern-based rests
- **Complex Episodes**: 20-30% rest chance between fragments per voice
- **Cadences**: 20% dramatic opening rest, 30% pre-resolution rest

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing fugue functionality remains unchanged
- Rest support is additive - existing code continues to work
- No breaking changes to API or configuration
- Performance impact is minimal

## Testing

Comprehensive testing performed:
- ✅ Subject generation with varied rest patterns
- ✅ Transformation preservation of rests (transpose, invert, retrograde)
- ✅ Episode generation with strategic rests
- ✅ Countersubject complementary rest placement
- ✅ Complex episode staggered entries
- ✅ Cadential dramatic rest placement
- ✅ MIDI playback handling of rests

## Usage

No configuration changes required. Rest support is automatically included in fugue generation:

```yaml
sequencer:
  direction_pattern: fugue  # Rests now included automatically
  density: 0.7              # Affects stretto overlap (not rest generation)
  bpm: 120                  # Affects overall timing including rests
```

The enhancement maintains the existing fugue mode interface while providing significantly more musical and expressive output through strategic use of rests.
