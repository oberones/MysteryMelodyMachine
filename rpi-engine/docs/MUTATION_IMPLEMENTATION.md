# Phase 5: Mutation Engine Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Mutation Engine for the Mystery Music Station project according to the specifications in ROADMAP.md and SPEC.md.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Mutation Engine (`src/mutation.py`)
- **MutationRule class**: Defines how parameters can be mutated with weights, delta ranges, and descriptions
- **MutationEngine class**: Main engine that schedules and applies mutations
- **MutationEvent class**: Records mutation history for logging and analysis

### 2. Key Features
- **Weighted Random Selection**: Parameters are selected for mutation based on configurable weights
- **Bounded Delta Application**: Changes are applied within specified ranges and respect parameter bounds
- **Scheduled Mutations**: Automatic mutations every 120-240 seconds (configurable)
- **Threading Support**: Runs in background thread with thread-safe operations
- **Mutation History**: Tracks last 100 mutations with timestamps and details
- **Statistics API**: Provides real-time stats on mutation engine status

### 3. Default Mutation Rules
The engine includes 8 default mutation rules targeting key parameters:

| Parameter | Weight | Delta Range | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `bpm` | 2.0 | ±5.0 | Tempo drift |
| `swing` | 1.5 | ±0.05 | Swing adjustment |
| `density` | 3.0 | ±0.1 | Density variation |
| `note_probability` | 2.5 | ±0.05 | Note probability shift |
| `filter_cutoff` | 2.0 | ±10.0 | Filter cutoff drift |
| `reverb_mix` | 1.5 | ±5.0 | Reverb mix adjustment |
| `sequence_length` | 1.0 | ±2 | Sequence length change |
| `drift` | 1.5 | ±0.05 | BPM drift envelope |

### 4. Integration with Main Application
- **Automatic startup**: Mutation engine starts when main application starts
- **Graceful shutdown**: Properly stops when application terminates
- **State integration**: Works seamlessly with the existing state management system
- **Logging integration**: All mutations are logged with structured messages

### 5. Configuration
Mutations are fully configurable via `config.yaml`:
```yaml
mutation:
  interval_min_s: 120    # Minimum time between mutations
  interval_max_s: 240    # Maximum time between mutations
  max_changes_per_cycle: 2  # Max parameters changed per cycle
```

### 6. Testing
Comprehensive test suite (`tests/test_mutation.py`) with 20 test cases covering:
- Rule creation and delta application
- Weighted selection algorithms
- Mutation bounds and validation
- Threading safety
- Integration with state system
- History and statistics tracking

## Technical Highlights

### Thread Safety
- Uses `threading.RLock()` for concurrent access
- Safe mutation of shared state across threads
- Proper cleanup on shutdown

### Error Handling
- Validates parameters before mutation
- Graceful handling of missing parameters
- Bounded mutations respect state validation rules

### Performance
- Minimal overhead when not mutating
- Efficient weighted selection algorithm
- History trimming prevents memory growth

### Observability
- Structured logging for all mutation events
- Statistics API for monitoring
- Mutation history for analysis

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from mutation import create_mutation_engine
from config import MutationConfig
from state import get_state

config = MutationConfig(interval_min_s=60, interval_max_s=120, max_changes_per_cycle=2)
state = get_state()
mutation_engine = create_mutation_engine(config, state)

mutation_engine.start()  # Begin automatic mutations
# ... application runs ...
mutation_engine.stop()   # Clean shutdown
```

### Manual Triggering
```python
mutation_engine.force_mutation()  # Trigger immediate mutation
stats = mutation_engine.get_stats()  # Get current statistics
history = mutation_engine.get_history(count=10)  # Get last 10 mutations
```

### Custom Rules
```python
from mutation import MutationRule

# Add custom mutation rule
custom_rule = MutationRule(
    parameter="custom_param",
    weight=2.0,
    delta_range=(-0.2, 0.2),
    description="Custom parameter drift"
)
mutation_engine.add_rule(custom_rule)
```

## Compliance with Specifications

✅ **ROADMAP.md Requirements**:
- Scheduler picks random time in [interval_min_s, interval_max_s]
- Selects up to max_changes_per_cycle parameters based on weighted categories
- Applies small bounded delta with clamp
- Emits event log + LED cue potential

✅ **SPEC.md Requirements**:
- Scheduled mild parameter perturbations every 2–4 minutes
- Mutation engine provides weighted random scheduling
- Proper separation of responsibilities (no direct synthesis logic)
- Structured logging with key=value style

✅ **Python Coding Standards**:
- Type hints throughout
- Proper virtual environment usage
- Module naming: snake_case.py
- Classes: PascalCase
- Dependency injection through constructors

## Demo
A demonstration script (`demo_mutation.py`) shows the mutation engine in action, displaying:
- Initial parameter values
- Mutation rules and weights
- Real-time mutation application
- History tracking
- Statistics monitoring

Run with: `python demo_mutation.py`

## Status
✅ **Phase 5: Mutation Engine** - **COMPLETE**
✅ **Phase 7: Mutation & Drift** - **COMPLETE** (BPM drift envelope + logging)

The mutation engine is fully implemented, tested, and integrated into the main application, ready for the next development phases.
